                    <p>Every memory, every emotion, able to be preserved when it bubbles up in your heart and mind, and shared, or delivered at some point in the future, either a specific date for a special birthday or anniversary, or as insurance that you’ve left these words to be considered at some point after your passing, 1 year, 1 day, or 5 years. We maintain contact with your contacts, keeping their information current to ensure as much as they will allow that your words will be delivered unimpeded and intact.</p>
                    <p>Your last messages are not an official will, and there is no lawyer, or 3rd party changing the feel of your words or intents.</p>
