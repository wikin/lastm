                <p>LastMessages origin came from a dear childhood friend, Hank Jacoby, of the founder, Skip Middleton reuniting after a multi-decade absence. The two friends caught up on life, on philosophies, and the founder’s friend, Hank was going through a new chapter of his life. He had settled down in his position, he had a large civic responsibility, and was engaged to his recently found soul mate. Just beginning a mayoral campaign in a small town in Indiana, the two discussed philosophies, plans, and approach to life, family, and the past. Hank reached out to Skip and said he wanted to thank him for something that had made a change in his life. The conversation went like this: </p>

                    <div class="discussion-text">;) Well you've done right by me before; more than you can ever know. I'll tell you about it when I can look you in the eyes so you know the full weight of my appreciation. I'll always be in your debt.</div>

                    <div class="discussion-text">Agreed.</div>
                </div>
    

                <p>While the two had many more conversations over the next 60 days, this conversation was not brought up. Middleton assumed he’d hear the rest of the story at Jacoby’s upcoming wedding, or some other event that would draw the two together. The last conversation was in April with Jacoby outlining his totally disruptive approach to politics that would allow him to lead his small town of Salem Indiana into a new era of harmony between politics and economic development of the region. 24 hours later, Middleton received a text informing him that Hank had died in his sleep the same night they talked.</p>

                <blockquote>
                  &ldquo;Nothing haunts us like the things we&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;say&hellip;&rdquo;
                  <footer>Mitch Albom</footer>
                </blockquote>


                <p>Fast forward to a month after Hank’s funeral, and Skip was thinking of words he felt needed to be said to his 16 year old son, Conor. Teenage sons don’t always want to hear how proud their parents are, nor life lessons that need to be carried into adulthood. Middleton reflected on a Michael Keaton movie from the early 90’s, “My Life” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udkv5nZ7gcw">Watch Trailer at YouTube</a>) and the entire concept flooded in, to leave a message for later delivery, and ensure Conor saw it regardless if Middleton was alive or not.</p>
