                    <h2>Are my Last Message capsules able to be used as my video will?</h2>
                    <p>As of the time of this publication, please ask a legal professional in your country or state (each country, and state has different rules on what constitutes a legal will). We do not believe our service, as yet, is acceptable as a legally binding will.</p>

                    <h2>How does the Trustee function work?</h2>
                    <p>Trustees are appointed in the written request, and each trustee has to officially accept the responsibility of becoming your trustee. Using our proprietary technology, when our service has not heard from you in the allotted time, the Trustee Initiation Process is triggered. If you have appointed more than one trustee, both have to initiate the sequence to trigger your account deliveries.</p>

                    <h2>Why do I need Trustee services?</h2>
                    <p>In the unfortunate event of your demise or incapacitation, our services are activated. While you can request bypass of the trustee services, we encourage you to have a backup notification, in case you have forgotten about the service or are out of touch from our worldwide notification center.</p>

                    <h2>Amy I able to load messages for delivery for any occasion or can this only be used after I&nbsp;die?</h2>
                    <p>Many of our users find our service convenient to use for birthday and anniversary notifications on a daily basis. They leave a grandchild, or sibling a birthday video recording while it is on their mind and in their thoughts, and set the delivery for a future date, just for the convenience of the product.</p>

                    <h2>Why such a morbid service?</h2>
                    <p>There is a saying, “Always leave loved ones with loving words, it may be the last time you ever see them…” Our founders have had these moments of regret, too often, and heard of many more instances with others. Our goal is to have many loved ones know exactly what wasn’t said due to tempers, or time, anger or emotion by using our services.</p>
